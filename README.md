StatisticsJS
============

Embarrassingly basic, yet flexible statistics library focused around finding the minimum, maximum, mean, variance, or deviation of a set. It also allows binning a series into a set of ranges and applying a statistical function to those ranges.

It is implemented as an AMD module, so you'll need your favorite library that provides an AMD define() function.
